- [ ] Configure production database connection
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS endpoints

#### 2. SSO System Integration
- [ ] Register application with SSO system
- [ ] Configure SSO callback URLs
- [ ] Test SSO integration in staging environment
- [ ] Verify role mappings with SSO administrators
- [ ] Set up SSO monitoring and alerting

#### 3. Security Configuration
- [ ] Generate and deploy production JWT keys
- [ ] Configure token expiration policies
- [ ] Set up CORS policies for production
- [ ] Implement request rate limiting
- [ ] Configure security headers

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Checklist

#### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Required - No defaults provided
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=generate-strong-secret-key-256-bits

# SSO Configuration
SSO_BASE_URL=https://your-sso-system.com
SSO_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret

# Optional - Has defaults
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS=24
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS=7
```

#### Database Migration
```bash
# When database is ready
alembic upgrade head
```

#### Redis Setup (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# For permission caching
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

### üîó Integration Points to Address

#### 1. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Provide JWT token handling examples
- [ ] Document authentication flow for frontend team

- [ ] Set up CORS policies
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Configure health checks

#### 3. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Set up authentication success/failure monitoring
- [ ] Configure security event logging
- [ ] Set up token expiration alerts
- [ ] Monitor SSO integration health
- [ ] Set up performance metrics collection

### üß™ Testing Requirements

#### 1. Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with actual SSO system
- [ ] Validate role mappings with real SSO data
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] End-to-end authentication flow testing

#### 2. User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Validate permission enforcement
- [ ] Test token refresh workflows
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior

### üìã Follow-up Tasks for Next Iterations

#### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. **T2.2 Application Management APIs**
   - Implement CRUD operations for applications
   - Integrate with authentication middleware
   - Add role-based access control

2. **Database Migration**
   - Create initial migration for user tables
   - Set up database triggers for auto-calculation
   - Initialize audit log tables

3. **Development Environment**
   - Set up development SSO mock server
   - Configure local testing environment
   - Create developer documentation

#### Medium Term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. **Enhanced Security**
   - Implement token blacklisting for logout
   - Add multi-factor authentication support
   - Implement session monitoring

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize JWT token validation performance
   - Implement permission caching strategies
   - Add connection pooling optimization

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Set up authentication metrics dashboard
   - Implement security event monitoring
   - Add performance monitoring

#### Long Term (Future Releases)
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Single sign-on across multiple applications
   - Advanced role hierarchy management
   - Audit log analytics and reporting

2. **Scalability**
   - Distributed session management
   - Load balancer integration
   - High availability setup

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

#### Security Risks
- [ ] Implement proper JWT secret key rotation
- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated for security patches

#### Performance Risks
- [ ] Monitor SSO API response times
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker for SSO calls
- [ ] Set up database connection monitoring
- [ ] Plan for high-traffic scenarios

#### Integration Risks
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Plan for SSO system downtime scenarios
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### üìû Stakeholder Communication
